                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my website! I am an AI researcher and user who
                    focuses on ensemble LLMs. </p>
                <p>
                    Ensembles are when you take multiple models and combine
                    their outputs to get better results than any single model
                    could achieve on its own. I am particularly interested in
                    how these models can work together to categorize
                    unstructured text data more effectively.</p>
                <p>My research explores the potential of multi-LLM
                    collaboration, where different language models (LLMs) can
                    share insights and improve their performance through
                    collective intelligence. This approach not only enhances the
                    accuracy of text categorization but also opens up new
                    avenues for understanding complex data sets.</p>
                <p>In addition to my research, I am also passionate about
                    sharing knowledge and insights
                    with the community. Through this website, I aim to provide
                    updates on my work and also show off my skills and any
                    products I make.</p>
